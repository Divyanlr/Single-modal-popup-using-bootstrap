# Single-modal-popup-using-bootstrap


1. HTML Structure
     create the basic HTML structure for the modal, along with a button to trigger it.

2. Bootstrap CSS & JavaScript
    Bootstrap's modal requires both CSS and JavaScript for full functionality, such as handling the modal's opening and closing actions

3. CSS 
    add custom CSS to tweak the appearance of the modal to fit design requirements.


How It Works
	1. When the user clicks the trigger button, the modal will appear.
	2. The user can close the modal by clicking the close button (x) in the header or the close button in the footer, both of which will trigger data-bs-dismiss="modal" to hide the modal.
	3. The modal is also automatically accessible for screen readers with proper aria labels like aria-labelledby and aria-hidden.
